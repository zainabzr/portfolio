          <h3>Terrorism and Regime Types: an empirical Analysis</h3>
          <p>This paper aimed to empirically analyze the relationship between terrorism and regime types, 
            including the various other elements that separate states from each other, such as judicial 
            independence, etc. To evaluate this relationship, I conducted a panel 
            regression analysis of secondary data from the Global Terrorism Database for 13 countries over 
            the time period 2006 to 2018 using Stata. This paper supported existing research that terrorism is significantly impacted by the type of regime, where the weak 
            democracies and failed states suffer more terrorism than other regime types.

          <h3>Exploring Gender and Nationality Narratives in the Halls of MoMA</h3>
          <p>In 2019, one of the most famous art museums in the world, the Museum of
            Modern Art, shook the art world with the announcement that it would remain closed for four
            months to make sweeping changes that align with its efforts towards inclusivity and diversity. This project aims to examine trends in the acquisition of art by the MoMA
            through the lens of Gender and Nationality.
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Research Questions:</strong> <li>What is the gender distribution of artists in the MOMA collection?
            </li><li>What is the nationality distribution of artists in the MOMA collection?
             </li><li>Are there any significant shifts in the acquisition of art by artists with diverse
              backgrounds?</li>
